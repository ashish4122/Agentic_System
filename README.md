## 📖 Description

**Multi-Agent Problem Solving System**

The system employs three specialized AI agents working in concert:
- **TesterAgent** generates small test cases
- **BruteAgent** creates a correct but inefficient solution
- **OptimalAgent** iteratively develops an efficient solution, validated against the brute force output

This approach ensures correctness through differential testing while achieving optimal time complexity through AI-guided iteration.
